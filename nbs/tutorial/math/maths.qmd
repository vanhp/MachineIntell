## Linear Algebra for Maching Learning
Understanding Linear Algebra is essential in Machine Learning. It's a tool that the main compute that the machine use to calulate the value it finally presented as the result.

Since input data must be convert to matrices form for the machine to operate on using Matix operation rules.
One of the most frequent uses operation is matrix multiplication or MatMul for short and Python event have it own symbol for this "@" e.g.
$$ A@B $$

::: {.callout-tip}

matrix multiplication $AxB$
:::

- Vector
- Matrix



## Differential Equation In Machine Learning

On the other hand, Diffential Equation is used in calculate **back propragation**. It's used inconjunction with *chain-rule* to adjust the input in order to getting closer to actual value

- Differential Equation

   $$\frac{du}{dt} = pu  $$

## Ordinary differential Equation (ODE)


md"$\frac{du}{dt} = pu = f(u,p,t)$"

```{julia}

import Pkg; Pkg.add("Plotly")
using DifferentialEquations

using Plots


f(u,p,t) = p * u 

interest_p = 1.0
balance_begin = 1.0
t_begin = 0.0
t_end = 1.0
tspan = (t_begin,t_end)

prob = ODEProblem(f,balance_begin,tspan,interest_p)
sol = solve(prob)

plot(sol,
    legend = false,
    linewidth = 2,
    title = "Compound Interest",
    xaxis = "Time in Years",
    yaxis = "Balance in Dollars",
    formatter = :plain,
    widen = true
)


```
#### Euler Number 

euler_question = "what is the balance after one year if the begin balance is 1 dollar the the interest rate is 100% compound continously"

```julia
print(euler_question)
euler = sol(1)
answer = "answer is 2.718 dollars"
print(answer)
euler_num = â„¯
print("euler_number: $euler_num")
```

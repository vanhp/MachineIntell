A Mathematic branch that try to understand the changing world by study things that are continuouly changing. Calculus has two branches:

- [Differential calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_calculus) 
- [Integral calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral)


## [Differential Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation)

A branch of Differential Calculus that work with problem involving how some thing change affected other related thing is called Differential Equation. It try to understand how an independent variable $\color{lime}{x}$ change induce a dependent variable $\color{lime}{y}$ to change and try to find the solution to it. It is used in Physic, Economy, Biology etc...

In Mathematic Differential means a proces to find the *derivative* or *slope* or in lay term the *rate of change*. Differential Equation means an equation involving with thing that changing which has the derivative as part of the equation.

There are many types of Differential Equations here are a few of the main one are:

- [Ordinary Differential Equation ODE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation)  
- [Partial Differential Equations PDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation)
- [Non-linear Differential Equations NLDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_system#Nonlinear_differential_equations)

The ODE dealing with only one independent variable. While Partial Differential Equation dealing with multiple independent variables and Non-linear Differential Equation work with non linear system.

### Ordinary Differential  Equation (ODE)
ODE dealing with how a dependent variable changed with respect to a single independent variable changed(derivative).

  ODE general equation form: $y^{(n)}= F\left (x,y,y',\ldots, y^{(n-1)} \right )$

#### Problem: compute the compound Interest of a bank account
Here an example of ODE problem: figure out the compound interest of a bank account.
A bank account has interest which accrues when the interest get added to original balance. What would be the banlance at the end of one year, five years or any day, month, year?

  simplify form: $\frac{du}{dt} = pu = f(u,p,t)$

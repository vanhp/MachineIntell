## Our new secret weapon for productivity

Today we’re excited to announce that we’ve teamed up with Quarto to give [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai) superpowers. nbdev offers Python programmers a common set of tools for using Jupyter notebooks to:

* Write & distribute software packages
* Test code, and
* Author documentation and technical articles

Although notebooks are already widely used for once-off exploratory work, it’s less well-known that they are perfectly capable of writing quality software. In fact, we’ve used nbdev for a wide range of software projects over the last three years, including [deep learning libraries,](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) [API clients](https://github.com/fastai/ghapi), [Python language extensions](https://github.com/fastai/fastcore), [terminal user interfaces](https://github.com/nat/ghtop), and more. We discovered that it is not only capable of writing great software but that it **has also increased our productivity by 300% or more**. With nbdev, developers simply write notebooks with lightweight markup and get high-quality documentation, tests, continuous integration, and packaging for free!  Nbdev has allowed us to maintain and scale many[ open source projects](https://github.com/fastai). Pull requests are often accompanied by detailed documentation and tests–contributors simply write notebooks.

This is why we’re excited to share nbdev v2. It’s rewritten from the ground up, with much-anticipated features including:

## Generative AI

A term that use to distinquist the Large Language Model from vanilla Language Model that have very large set of parameters. 

GAI has a characteristic of the ability to generate language response similiar to human generate content.
It's base on Transformer architect ans was trained on very large set unlabelled data set.

GAI is classified as unsupervised or self-supervised machine learning since they are trained with large corpus of data with minimal or none of labelled.

It unique ability is to response to input prompt to regenerate content. It may be response to only text to generate text output *unimodal* or able to response to more than text *multi-modal* e.g. text, source code and images then generate either text, source code or image or all

Generative AI Model that response to prompt and
